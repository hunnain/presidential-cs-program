In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.",

Additionally, there has been a move from being bound to a single, closed-source vendor to an open-source model with multiple vendors, resulting in less risk of lock-in and more choice. All the major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. have adopted this cloud native approach. In this module we will learn about the history, current status and future of cloud native computing."

Assuming no prior programming experience on the part of the student, this module starts by focusing on the fundamentals of composing code with JavaScript. Introduction to only server based JavaScript/TypeScript is covered i.e. Node.js.

In recent years, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) has emerged as the standard architectural design for web services and web APIs. In this module, students will see how easy it is to create a RESTful web service using Node.js, TypeScript and the Express micro-framework. Students will also learn gRPC and GraphQL based microservices. By the end of the module, students will be able to use JavaScript/Typescript to build a Node microservice and know how to test it, hook it up to a database, and automate the development process."
